This file documented the project requirement. The document outline the definition of each measurement is taking and provide the details of the project objective.

## Abstract ##
This project aims to develop a website where the user can upload a file which has an Artificial Intelligence Question & Answer quiz generator in order to enhance students' learning experience as well as improve teachers' qualitative work by giving them more time to deal with other activities such as assignments correction, general grading, and class preparation.

## Objective ##
The aim of this project is to use Natural Language Processing to create an Artificial Intelligence algorithm that will be generated by using the SQUAD (The Stanford Question Answering Dataset) dataset to receive a piece of text and generate questions in relation to the contents of a file or URL.

These questions could be either multiple-choice, fill in the blanks, true or false, or binary style questions, which will be analysed and returned to the professor in a feedback format showcasing which areas the students are struggling more to understand.

In other words, this system can be interpreted as a real-time student progress dashboard that will give the professor an idea of how his/her students are doing and if they need any specific support throughout the semester.
